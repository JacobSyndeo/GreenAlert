# Introduction

What is GreenAlert, and why should you use it?

## What is GreenAlert?

GreenAlert is a really useful way to use `UIAlertController`, using extensions.

Let's say you want to show a basic alert.

Rather than writing this:
```swift
let alertController = UIAlertController(title: "Title", message: "Message")

let okAction = UIAlertAction(title: "OK", style: .default) { _ in
    ()
}

alertController.addAction(okAction)

present(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

You can write this:
```swift
UIAlertController.showBasicAlert("Title", message: "Message")
```

Not a big enough difference for you? Okay, let's suppose you've got a more complicated one.

Instead of THIS:
```swift
let alertController = UIAlertController(title: "Title", message: "Message")

let cancelAction = UIAlertAction(title: "Cancel", style: .cancel) { _ in
    // handle Cancel
}

let okAction = UIAlertAction(title: "OK", style: .default) { _ in
    // handle OK
}

alertController.addAction(cancelAction)
alertController.addAction(okAction)

present(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

Why not have this:
```swift
UIAlertController.showOKCancelAlert("Title", message: "Message") { confirmed in
    // Handle OK or Cancel based on `confirmed` being true or false
}
```

Or, if you're using Swift Concurrency:
```swift
if await UIAlertController.showOKCancelAlert("Title", message: "Message") {
    // User tapped OK!
}
```

Now, isn't that nicer?

_But wait, there's more._

With GreenAlert, you're granted all sorts of `UIAlertController` superpowers, including the following:
- Customizations galore
  - SAFELY set alert style to action sheet, using enums to enforce the presence of source information.
    - I say "safely" here because you can easily crash an iPadOS app by creating an `.actionSheet` and forgetting to set the `popoverPresentationController`'s `sourceView`, `sourceRect`, or `barButtonItem`. These crashes don't occur on iPhones, and are therefore easy to miss if you don't test throughly. Using GreenAlert eliminates these crashes.
  - Custom button action icons, via SF Symbols (preferred) or a `UIImage`
- Show prompts for values
    - With all the customizations listed above, but also including customizable:
        - preset text
        - placeholder
        - keyboard type
- Add progress bars to alert controllers
